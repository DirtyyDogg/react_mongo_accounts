## Example of basic account system on React and MongoDB
This is an example web application written in React to demonstrate basic account feature with MongoDB.
You can create an account and sign in with email or tokens.  
I borrowed ( ported ) most of code from Meteor's account package which I love.
I ported Meteor's account package because I could not find good examples to develop simple signup/signin system without using Meteor when I start using React
